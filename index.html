            <h4> The Problem</h4>
            <p> The problem we were solving was to restructure the navigation on the Helping Paws website to better the accessibility, and improve the overall aesthetics.</p>
            <p class="lead"></p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <h4>The Solution </h4>
            <p>Through a combination of user interviews, competitor analysis, and a heuristic analysis of the current website we researched what the key problems were and how we might fix them. We embraced the no bad ideas throughout the research and ideation phases to flesh out different solutions to the problem.</p>
            <p class="lead">

          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="Research">
              <img class="mr-3" src="images/research.png">
              <div class="media-body">
                Research was conducted in a few different ways. First we performed a competitor analysis to see what Helping Paws direct and indirect competition was doing. Next was a heurisitc evaluation to see what was working on the current website and what areas we noticed needed improvement. Lastly, we conducted user interviews over zoom and phone calls to figure out what our target audience needed in this website. 
              </div>

            <li class="Definition">
              <img class="mr-3" src="images/definition.png">
              <div class="media-body">
                The data collected during the interviews were entered into a miro board and synthesized into an affinity diagram. Which we used as key takeaways from our target audience on how we were going to proceed with the redesign. Although we ran into some difficulty finding our exact target audience to interview we were able to gather key insights from our adjacent target audience. From there we created our user persona, Sarah, as a young professional with a physical disability wanting to live an independent lifestyle but needing extra security and safety from a service dog.

              <div class="media-body">
              Taking the information we gathered from our research and user interviews we prioritized the features into a matrix. From that we discussed what would be the most importnat and feasible to accomplish during our project timeline. Then we decided the how we were going to impelement those features on the website redesign.

                <div class="media-body">
                    Our initial step was to revisit the sitemap. We took the current navigation elements and simplified the navigation so that there was no repetition, and clear navigation paths. We took that process and compbined it with the features we found during the research phase to start with low fidelity hand sketches. Those sketches turned into wireframes and eventually through rounds of testing and iterations it became a hi-fidelity protoype.
